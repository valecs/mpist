mpist: An MPI wrapper to allow the execution of many instances of a single-threaded program with a varrying envrionmental variable.

USAGE:
mpist [-h] [-G] -C ENVVAR -t n-m EXE [ARGS]

Executes EXE [ARGS] with the environmental varaible specified by ENVVAR set to integers in the range [n,m] inclusive. If there are insufficient MPI ranks available, the top of the range is silently truncated.

-h displays this message.
-G prevents actually exec-ing and just displays status.

Notes:
* It is required that m > n
* The environmental variable, ENVVAR, must be shorter than 127 characters.

COMPILING:
A simple call to make and will produce the binary. If xl compilers are available, they will be used.

EXAMPLES:

One might submit a cobalt job with mpist as:
% qsub -n 512 -t 20 mpist -G TASK_ID -t 1-8192 /path/to/my/single-thread/program [args...]
